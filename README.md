# Firebase onValue() - Intermittent Real-time Update Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with Firebase's `onValue()` method where real-time data updates were intermittent and inconsistent.  The issue was particularly difficult to debug due to its inconsistent nature.

## Problem Description

Data changes made in the Firebase console were not always reflected in the application using `onValue()`, even though all configurations, permissions, and code appeared correct. This made it challenging to identify the root cause.  The problem seemed random, occurring at different times and under various conditions.

## Solution

After significant investigation, it was discovered that the problem was related to the data structure and how changes were being made.  The original code attempted updates in a way that might have been too quick for `onValue()` to consistently catch. The solution involved restructuring how the data was updated (using transaction and server timestamps).  This ensured consistency and avoided potential race conditions or timing issues.
